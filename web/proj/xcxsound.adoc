# XCXSound

:features: lightbox

XCXSound is a tool that makes it easier to use custom music in Xenoblade
Chronicles X. Runs on Windows and Linux (OSX should work, but it's untested).

== How to use

[id=extracting]
=== Extracting and opening

* *On Windows:* Unzip the archive, right-click xcxsound.exe, and hit
  _Run as Administrator_.
* *On Linux:* You'll have to get it from source. Download the
  http://hub.darcs.net/refi64/xcxsound/dist[zip from Darcs Hub] or clone the
  source yourself via `darcs get http://hub.darcs.net/refi64/xcxsound`. Make
  sure you have Python 3.4+, PySide, and Wine installed, then run
  `python3 xcxsound.py`.

[id=basics]
=== Setting up XCXSound

The top-left field of the XCXSound window allows you to set the directory where
the music files will be stored. *This does not go on your SD card; it goes on
your main hard drive!* In most cases, the default is fine, so you can ignore
this option.

Set the _Game ID_ dropdown to your game's region. Note that I've only tested
XCXSound with the US region. After this, click the _Load_ button.

[id=editing]
=== Editing the songs

Select the song you want to change and click _Edit Song_. There are several
options at this point:

* *Reset* - Remove any modifications to the song.
* *Cancel* - Do nothing.
* *No music* - No music will be played.
* *Custom song* - Select an audio file to use. XCXSound uses FFmpeg, which means
  that a wide variety of music formats are supported, including `.mp3`, `.wav`,
  `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.m4a`, `.acc`, and more. Once you select the audio file to
  convert, XCXSound will automatically convert it to the proper format and loop
  it if necessary. Note that there is a catch when replacing the ambush music:
  if the song is under 30 seconds long, it will be padded with silence until it
  reaches 30 seconds in length. Fix? Just pick a longer song for the ambush
  music!!!

After this, you will be shown another dialog that lets you change the volume of
the music. Positive values increase the volume by the corresponding percentage,
and negative values decrease it. If you don't want to change the volume at all,
click _Don't Change_.

=== Connecting the Wii U to the computer

[id=computer]
==== On your computer

* Make note of your IP address on the bottom-ride of XCXSound.
* Click _Start Cafiine_ inside XCXSound. This will start up the Cafiine server.
  If the Windows firewall pops up and says it blocked Cafiine, make sure you
  select both check boxes, then hit _Allow access_.

[id=wii-u]
==== On the Wii U

* Open up the web browser and navigate to _loadiine.ovh_.
* Select _Cafiine + Kernel_ from the drop-down menu and hit _Submit_.
* Once you end up back at the main menu, return to the internet browser. After
  this, you should end up with a screen on the Wii U gamepad gamepad asking you
  to enter an IP address. Use the D-pad to enter the IP address you saw in
  XCXSound earlier, then hit the A button. Open up Xenoblade X and enjoy the
  custom music!

[id=rm-flight]
=== Removing the flight music

NOTE: This feature is still in testing!! Please read this section fully before
attempting to use it.

XCXSound can automatically try to replace the flight music with the normal
continent music, but there are some gotchas involved. In order to enable this,
just check the _No flight music_ checkbox before hitting _Start Cafiine_. Note
the following:

* This restarts the continent theme.
* If you cross a continent boundary, or the time changes between day and night,
  you need to land your skell, wait a second or so for the correct music to
  load, and then take off again.
* If you fast-travel, wait a few seconds before taking off flying to make sure
  the new music gets loaded.
* This will erase any previous flight music mods that you've done.
* After you're done with Cafiine, make sure you select the flight music in
  XCXSound and hit _Edit song_ -> _Reset_.

If you follow these directions carefully, it should work well!
