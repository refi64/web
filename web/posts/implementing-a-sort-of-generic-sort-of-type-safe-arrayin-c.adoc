+++I've been using C for a project I've been working on, and one thing I find annoying are manually-managed arrays. Ever since watching+++ link:+++https://youtu.be/YQs6IC-vgmo+++[+++Bjarne Stroustrup's talk on linked lists+++] +++, I try to avoid using those as much as possible. Therefore, I prefer using a container roughly equivalent to C++'s vector.+++

+++The obvious thing to do here would be to use something like+++ link:+++https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Arrays.html+++[+++glib's GArray type+++] +++or+++ link:+++http://wolkykim.github.io/qlibc/doc/html/qvector_8c.html+++[+++qlibc's qvector type+++] +++. However, both APIs require using+++ ``+++sizeof+++`` +++and are completely not-type-safe; it's easy to add a char to an array/vector of ints. This made me wonder: is it possible to implement a type-safe, generic array type in C?+++

+++Now, I mean the C version of type-safe, which basically means that your compiler has to show either a warning or an error (probably if compiling with+++ ``+++-Werror+++`` +++) when you try to append the wrong type to an array.+++
--

++++++ __+++Note that this implementation is not complete!+++__ +++The most obvious issues are that you can't pop elements off an array, and it resizes itself with every new addition, which is (obviously!) slow.+++

+++Also, it uses macros. If you're allergic to them...sucks to be you!+++

+++The API is basically like:+++

[source,c]
----

List(int*) mylist = NULL; // NULL represents the empty list.
int a=1, b=2;
list_append(mylist, &a);
// We can get the first element of the list with l[0] and the length with list_len:
printf("%zu %d\n", list_len(mylist), *mylist[0]); // Prints 1 1.
list_append(mylist, &b);
printf("%zu %d %d\n", list_len(mylist), *mylist[0], *mylist[1]); // Prints 2 1 2.
list_free(mylist);

----

+++Note that I used the term+++ ``+++list+++`` +++, not+++ ``+++array+++`` +++, since I'm a Python nerd.+++

+++I really like the fact that indexing a list is just+++ ``+++list[index]+++`` +++, not something like+++ ``+++get_element(list, index)+++`` +++or+++ ``+++list->array[index]+++`` +++.+++

+++Note that+++ __+++this only supports lists of pointer types+++__ +++. Don't try to use a non-pointer type. It either won't work, or it will work, but only on some platforms.+++

+++The code is available at+++ link:+++https://github.com/kirbyfan64/list+++[+++GitHub+++] +++.+++

[id=boilerplate]
== Boilerplate

[source,c]
----

#ifndef LIST_H
#define LIST_H

...

#endif

----

+++Yeah, we all know what this is for! Joyous header files.+++

+++Inside these header files is some more boilerplate:+++

[source,c]
----

#define list_cat2(a,b) a##b
#define list_cat(a,b) list_cat2(a,b)
#define list_var(b) list_cat(list_type_,list_cat(b,__LINE__))

----

+++This is just a way of creating anonymous, single-use variables inside a macro in order to avoid name clashes. Think Lisp's+++ ``+++gensym+++`` +++.+++

[id=basics]
== The basics

[source,c]
----

#define List(t) t*

----

++++++ __+++Now+++__ +++the interesting stuff starts! This is just a macro to make uses of the list type look like generics, so that I can do stuff like+++ ``+++List(int*)+++`` +++.+++

[source,c]
----

#define list_lenref(l) ((size_t*)l)[-1]

----

+++I think I need to explain a moment.+++

+++Lists are represented by a pointer to a length of type+++ ``+++size_t+++`` +++and the elements immediately after, like this:+++

[source,c]
----

struct my_list_type {
    size_t length;
    some_type my_array[size_here];
};

----

+++(Except that+++ ``+++my_array+++`` +++can be of any size.) However, the list is a pointer to the array, after the length. Therefore,+++ ``+++list_lenref+++`` +++(which gets the length of the list) needs to index BEFORE the given list to get the length.+++

+++Next is the definition of+++ ``+++list_len+++`` +++:+++

[source,c]
----

#define list_len(l) (l?list_lenref(l):0)

----

+++This is just a wrapper macro around+++ ``+++list_lenref+++`` +++to support getting the length of an empty list (+++ ``+++NULL+++`` +++).+++

[id=appending]
== Appending

+++Now is my personal favorite part: the definition of+++ ``+++list_append+++`` +++:+++

[source,c]
----

#define list_append(l,x) do {\
    size_t list_var(len) = list_len(l);\
    l = realloc(l?((void*)l)-sizeof(size_t):NULL,\
                sizeof(void*)*(list_var(len)+1)+sizeof(size_t))+sizeof(size_t);\
    list_lenref(l) = list_var(len)+1;\
    l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
} while (0)

----

+++This is definitely the biggest macro (and arguably the most important), so I'll explain it line-by-line:+++

+++First, the length of the list is saved in an anonymous variable:+++

[source,c]
----

size_t list_var(len) = list_len(l);\

----

+++Next, the list is+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++'d:+++

[source,c]
----

l = realloc(l?((void*)l)-sizeof(size_t):NULL,\
            sizeof(void*)*(list_var(len)+1)+sizeof(size_t))+sizeof(size_t);\

----

+++This alone deserves explanation, too! The first argument to+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++is the block of memory to be resized. If the list is+++ ``+++NULL+++`` +++, then+++ ``+++NULL+++`` +++is passed to+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++. Otherwise, the size of the length is subtracted from the pointer to get the beginning of the allocated memory.+++

+++The second argument is the size of the new memory block. This is the size of a pointer times the number of elements to be in the new list, which is just the old length plus 1.+++

+++A+++ ``+++sizeof(size_t)+++`` +++is then added to the result of the call to+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++to get a pointer to the elements.+++

+++I didn't worry about+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++returning+++ ``+++NULL+++`` +++, since this is just an example, and, in my use case, I'm calling a wrapper over+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++that aborts on out-of-memory errors.+++

+++After all that, the length of the list is updated:+++

[source,c]
----

list_lenref(l) = list_var(len)+1;\

----

+++If you're wondering why I didn't just use+++ ``+++++list_lenref(l)+++`` +++, it's because, if the list was empty before the append, the length will be uninitialized. Also,+++ ``+++list_lenref+++`` +++is used instead of+++ ``+++list_len+++`` +++because the latter is an rvalue because it handles empty lists, but we know the list is non-empty, and you can only assign to an l-value.+++

+++And the new element is assigned:+++

[source,c]
----

l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\

----

+++All of this is wrapped in a+++ ``+++do/while+++`` +++block to avoid+++ link:+++http://stackoverflow.com/a/154138/2097780+++[+++surprising issues+++] +++.+++

[id=freeing]
== Freeing the list

+++Last of all comes freeing a list:+++

[source,c]
----

#define list_free(l) free(l?(void*)l-sizeof(size_t):NULL)

----

+++If the list is empty, then it just tries to free+++ ``+++NULL+++`` +++, which does nothing. If the list is+++ __+++not+++__ +++empty, then+++ ``+++sizeof(size_t)+++`` +++is subtracted to get the beginning of the list, and that is freed.+++

[id=closing]
== Closing notes (and problems)

+++If you're wondering how the heck this is type-safe, consider:+++

[source,c]
----

List(int*) l;
char c=0;
list_append(l, &c);

----

+++If I try to compile this, my compiler (Clang) says:+++

[source]
----

tst.c:13:5: warning: incompatible pointer types assigning to 'int *' from 'char *' [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
    list_append(l, &c);
    ^              ~~
./list.h:16:25: note: expanded from macro 'list_append'
    l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
                        ^
1 warning generated.

----

+++GCC 4.9 (which is admittedly an old version) gives a slightly less helpful but still informative warning:+++

[source]
----

In file included from tst.c:5:0:
tst.c: In function ‘main’:
list.h:16:25: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
     l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
                         ^
tst.c:13:5: note: in expansion of macro ‘list_append’
     list_append(l, &c);
     ^

----

+++Intel's doesn't show the macro expansion, but it still works:+++

[source]
----

tst.c(13): warning #556: a value of type "char *" cannot be assigned to an entity of type "int *"
      list_append(l, &c);
      ^

----

+++You can see that the compiler always notices when something isn't right, and building with+++ ``+++-Werror+++`` +++will prevent this from even compiling.+++

+++As for problems with the implementation, there are a few:+++

* +++The list is always resized on every append, like I mentioned above. This would be a trivial change that I just haven't done yet.+++
* +++No popping from a list, which I also mentioned.+++
* +++No handling of a+++ ``+++realloc+++`` +++failure. Again, I mentioned this above, too.+++
* +++Error messages can be big. Just try something like+++ ``+++list_append(some_nonexistent_variable, 0)+++`` +++and you'll see what I mean. That gives a whopping 8 errors with Clang. GCC and Intel are much better here (they only show one), but you get the idea!+++

+++All in all, I still think this is a cool list implementation!+++
