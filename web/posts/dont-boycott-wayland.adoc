:description: This is a response to the "Boycott Wayland" gist, stating that we should \
              boycott Wayland because something something Red Hat evil and breakage \
              and...global menus? Well, there were quite a few exaggerations and \
              misrepresentations in the gist, which will be shown and explained here.

If you couldn't tell by the title, this is a response to
https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277[this gist], stating
that we should boycott Wayland because something something Red Hat evil and breakage
and...global menus? Well, there were quite a few exaggerations and misrepresentations in
the gist, which will be shown and explained here.

## Why is this misleading?

I'll start off with this: many of the links are misquoted, some don't even support the
points made with them, and some are highlighted supposed "broken" functionality with
either wrong dates or bugs that _have already been fixed_.

Yes, Wayland is different than Xorg. It was a complete re-imagining of how a modern and
less monolithic display protocol should look. Of course, breakage isn't necessarily a
_good_ thing...but at the same time, some form of breakage is going to be inevitable. As
we'll see soon, the breakage has mostly been confined to a few specific places (screen
capture most notably), where the current X way simply would not work with a more
secure protocol.

Now, I would be lying if I said this hasn't taken a long time to develop, or that I
haven't missed some of these features, but Linux apps and development are done by many
individual developers, whether volunteers or paid. As a result, a lot of work _does_ take
a long time to complete. That being said, X's current policy towards things like screen
capture and key binding is simply insecure, and it is inevitable that we will have to move
away from it eventually.

Furthermore, is it really worth throwing the entire protocol away for screen casting
(which works but needs more adoption) and...global menus? I've been using Wayland on my
primary system for ages, and the flag workarounds for screen capture in Chromium (as
mentioned below) have been working fine for me. It's not a perfect solution, but the
benefits Wayland provides have far exceeded the amount of time I've had to spend tweaking
the few things that weren't working out of the box.

Some of Xorg's core issues that required breakage to be solved in Wayland, such as it being
trivially easy to create keyloggers or view _any window without permissions_ really are
things that you'd expect to see /r/linuxmasterrace mocking Windows over, not problems that
we should ignore on a supposedly secure system.

One more thing I'd like to add: _many of these links honestly make no sense as sources_ or
were talking about entirely different things, with some discussion cherry-picked without
context. Without further ado...

## Screen recording exists...and it's not a Red Hat thing (?)

Screen recording has been available in Wayland for quite some time now, via
{link-pipewire} and {link-xdg-desktop-portal}. Now, the gist _does_ make allusions to this:

____
Or force more Red Hat/Gnome components (glib, Portals, Pipewire) on everyone! +[...]+
There is a workaround for OBS Studio that requires a obs-xdg-portal plugin (which is known
to be Red Hat/Flatpak-centric, GNOME-centric, "perhaps" works with other desktops)
____

This is...really, just completely wrong.

I have no idea why anything here would require clients to use GLib. All of the portal
APIs work over D-Bus, and Pipewire doesn't even require GLib.

xdg-desktop-portal is not a Red Hat, GNOME-specific, or even Flatpak-specific project; KDE has
https://github.com/KDE/xdg-desktop-portal-kde[a portal backend], and there's even
https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr[a backend for wlroots-based] compositors.
The portals
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=XDG-Desktop-Portal-Snapped[even have support for snapd].

Even just looking at the
https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/graphs/contributors[top contributors],
we see contributions from employees of Collabora, Igalia, and Mozilla, not just Red Hat.

Pipewire also is not really a project that's particularly tied to Red Hat; yes, the main
developer is from Red Hat, but he's also a multimedia expert and one of the two creators
of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer#Early_days[GStreamer] (a project founded while
the developer was still at Collabora). As of right now, Collabora is
https://www.collabora.com/about-us/open-source/open-source-projects/pipewire.html[a leading contributor to Pipewire as well].
Even http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/podcast-ep-003-paul-davis-on-fixing-big-linux-audio-issues#main:~:text=PipeWire%20is%20an%20interesting%20project[
the creator of JACK is interested in Pipewire], despite initially being skeptical.

A lot of the particular linked examples are just bizarre extrapolations:

____
https://github.com/mhsabbagh/green-recorder ("I am no longer interested in working with
things like ffmpeg/wayland/GNOME's screen caster or solving the issues related to them or
why they don't work")
____

This was targeting Linux screencasting _in general_ as highlighted by the ffmpeg reference.

____
https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG/issues/51 broken since at least 7 Mar 2020.
("I have now decided that there will be no Wayland support for the time being. Reason,
there is no budget for it. Let's see how it looks in a year or two.") - This is the key
problem. Wayland breaks everything and then expects others to fix the wreckage it caused
on their own expense.
____

Looks like I missed the part where the Wayland developers had the ability to update every
single project in existence and add full Wayland support. Better yet, the issue would
indicate more lack of time by the developer to be able to push updates, not that Wayland
"breaks everything".

____
https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2471 broken since at least 7 Mar 2020.
("Wayland is unsupported at this time", "There isn't really something that can just be
easily changed. Wayland provides no capture APIs")
____

Okay, this one is just laughable. An OBS developer also stated in the same thread:

____
For reference X11 solutions are very close to the worst possible interface one could design.
____

which would imply that we can't really stay with X screencasting either, thus ruining the
entire "just stick with X argument".

Better yet, https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14[there's already an RFC open for
Wayland support]. All the portals they mentioned as "incomplete" do already support the
screencast APIs anyway, so their knowledge at the time about it was likely already
outdated.

Now onto "screen sharing", which is the same API problem as "screen casting", but let's
entertain the idea that it's actually two separate points:

____
https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/2350 broken since 3 Jan 2018

https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389 broken since 24 Jan 2016 ("Closing since
there is nothing we can do from the Jitsi Meet side.") See? Wayland breaks stuff and
leaves application developers helpless and unable to fix the breakage, even if they wanted.
____

First off...this is two issues from the same repo. How does this count as two separate
breakages? I don't even know where "2016" comes from, because the second issue was created
this year.

The quoted text was not in response to Wayland missing functionality; Pipewire already
existed at this point. Rather it was related to browsers implementing the screencast API.
This has been implemented in Chromium behind a flag for years at least, and it was only
behind a flag because parts of Chromium's UI flow assumed there was no permissions model,
so it would ask the user to select a window to share after they already selected it in the
Wayland compositor. This is actively being worked on in both
https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src/+/189544[WebRTC] and
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1942327[Chromium itself].

Firefox has had it in Fedora via downstream patches for quite some time as well, and
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672944[it's also being actively worked on].

____
https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22 Zoom broken since at least 4 Jan 2019.
("Can not start share, we only support wayland on GNOME with Ubuntu (17, 18), Fedora (25
to 29), Debian 9, openSUSE Leap 15, Arch Linux"). No word about non-GNOME!
____

"Yes, let's highlight a Linux client that is notoriously buggy and generally terrible."

## Global menus

Again, I don't know why this is split into three sections. But first off:

____
https://gitlab.com/lestcape/Gnome-Global-AppMenu/-/issues/116 broken since 24 Aug 2018
("because the lack of the Gtk+ Wayland support for the Global Menu")
____

*The issue had nothing to do with this, and this is a gross misquoting.* The issue reads:

____
This Gtk+4 fact, will be sad and will make Gtk+ unusable to the Gnome Global Menu
extension, as it's implemented now. That's why the Gnome Global Menu extension will be
discontinued again. The first reason was because the lack of the Gtk+ Wayland support for
the Global Menu, that was resolved here and now will be because Gtk+ will no longer
supports generic loadable modules.
____

In other words, this issue was showing something unrelated, and at the time, Wayland
support was already working. The date used in the gist ("broken since 24 Aug 2018") is
also incorrect, since it's pointing to the date the linked issue was filed, at which point
Wayland support was again working.

GTK's own lack of support for global menus over Wayland itself had little to do with
Wayland and more to do with GTK itself not wanting to support global menus, as the current
global menu implementation was very closely targeting Xorg.

Next up:

____
https://blog.broulik.de/2016/10/global-menus-returning/ ("it uses global window IDs, which
don’t exist in a Wayland world... no global menu on Wayland, *I thought*, not without
significant re-engineering effort").
____

In other words...if you actually read the article, they were able to make it work on
Wayland *without* the re-engineering. In fact, the whole point of the article was to
highlight that they were able to get it to work.

____
KDE had to do additional work to work around it. And it still did not work:

https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=385880 broken. ("When using the Plasma-Wayland
session, the global menu does not work.")
____

The linked bug literally says this was fixed in 5.20.

____
https://blog.broulik.de/2016/10/global-menus-returning/ broke non-KDE platformplugins. As
a result, global menus now need _KDE_NET_WM_APPMENU_OBJECT_PATH which only the KDE
platformplugin sets, leaving everyone else in the dark
____

*This is literally the same link as above*. Why is this a separate point?

In addition, non-KDE Qt apps already often needed tweaks to expose global menus,
because _it was always a separate plugin_ and not part of Qt itself, as
https://askubuntu.com/questions/588844/how-to-enable-global-application-menu-in-rstudio[shown
by these hacks to make global menus work in RStudio].

## AppImages being required to ship a Qt plugin

____
https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2018/03/unsetting-qt_qpa_platform-environment-variable-by-default/
broke AppImages that don't ship a special Wayland Qt plugin. "This affects proprietary
applications, FLOSS applications bundled as appimages, FLOSS applications bundled as
flatpaks and not distributed by KDE and even the Qt installer itself. In my opinion this
is a showstopper for running a Wayland session."
____

*Once again, this has been fixed:*

____
The best solution is for Qt including the QPA platform plugin and having a proper
auto-detection based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE. The situation will improve with Qt 5.11, but it
doesn’t really help as the Qt LTS versions will continue to face the problem.

For now we implemented a change in Plasma 5.13 so that we don’t need to set the env variable
any more. Plasma is able to select the appropriate platform plugin based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE
environment variable. Non-Plasma processes will use the default platform plugin. With Qt
< 5.11 this is xcb, with Qt 5.11 this will most likely change to wayland. KDE’s flatpak
applications pick Wayland by default in a Wayland session and are unaffected by the change.
____

Really, I'd argue the actual problem is trying to bundle every individual dependency into
a single file and expecting the users to never have to add anything else? This is pretty
bizarre especially because it's no different than having to include the global menu
platform plugin to make global menus work, which AppImages already need! In other words,
this is just an AppImage problem and its style clashing with the Qt reliance on various
forms of dynamically-loaded plugins.

## Side note: what issues does Wayland solve?

The opening to the article says:

____
Wayland solves no issues I have
____

I'd like to make a quick jab at this statement: just because you don't have issues doesn't
imply that aren't issues that others are stuck dealing with or fixing. Xorg's APIs are
quite nasty, and developers have to deal with them. There are things that Wayland can
support easily but X cannot, and there are people who have to deal with those.

https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Is-Wayland-the-New-X[This article] covers
a few of the reasons X is a mess:

____
Stone traces the earliest origins of Wayland to a page on the X.Org wiki started by Adam Jackson called X12. “It wasn’t a serious attempt at a design,” Stone stresses, “but a list of things we would do differently if we had a chance to rework the core protocol.”

For many developers, this list helped codify the problems with X11. “Some of these issues were just out-and-out problems with the core protocol,” Stone says, “but a lot of them were to do with the fact that, in the 26 years since X11 was created, everything around it has changed, both hardware and applications.” Admittedly, X is extensible, but, *with the average X server running an average of 23 out of 27 extensions, many X developers feel that “we’ve kicked that can as far down the road as we can.”*

To make matters worse, because X.org policy is never to break backward compatibility, *today, X includes four separate input models “reflecting the evolution from keyboard and three-button mouse to full multi-touch,” four display models, and two rendering models – not one of which has priority over the others, even though some are obsolete*.

Consequently, the effort to keep X11 running is passing the point of diminishing returns. Although the last few years have seen numerous improvements, most of the easy improvements have already been implemented. Typically today, “*Solving even the most tiny of issues, if [it was] actually solvable at all, would involve a massively disproportionate amount of effort – which would, in itself, create problems in the future,*” says Stone.

Wayland has seen
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Sony-Using-Flutter-Wayland[significant
adoption in the embedded space]:

____
+[...]+ increasing number of embedded/SoC vendors focusing on Wayland support over other
display stacks +[...]+
____

It's even

in TVs]:

____
Even if Wayland was not used on Linux desktop, a bunch of embedded devices have been using
Wayland for their display server for quite some time. LG has been shipping a full Wayland
experience on the webOS TV products.
____

Of course, as mentioned in the intro, there are very real security benefits as well. I
think it would be rather misguided then to only show it as a source of breakage and
problems, rather than something that caused breakage in order to improve what could not
be improved with the same APIs.
