++++++ link:+++http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/+++[+++Wheels+++] +++are the future of distribution. No more messy broken setup.py scripts or need for a compiler to build C extensions! Of course, this has a glaring issue: a Linux user can't build Wheels of their C extension for Windows. Unless, of course, you use+++ link:+++https://travis-ci.org/+++[+++Travis CI+++] +++, install the MinGW compilers, define the compiler variables, etc. However, there is an easier way:+++ link:+++http://www.appveyor.com+++[+++AppVeyor+++] +++.+++

+++AppVeyor uses a simple configuration file that uses YAML. Here is what the config file for your project might look like:+++

[source,yaml]
----

install:
  - ps: (new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py', 'C:/get-pip.py')
  - C:/Python34/python.exe C:/get-pip.py
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install wheel
build_script:
  - python setup.py build
test_script:
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/py.test
deploy_script:
  - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload

----

+++It goes into a file named appveyor.yml. Here's what's going on, one piece at a time:+++

[source,yaml]
----

install:

----

+++The install section defines commands to run for installation.+++

[source,yaml]
----

- ps: (new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py', 'C:/get-pip.py')
- C:/Python34/python.exe C:/get-pip.py

----

+++These two lines install pip. The first uses PowerShell to download the install script; the second runs it.+++

[source,yaml]
----

- C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install wheel
- C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install pytest

----

+++The first line installs wheel. The second is optional; it just installs pytest (a unit testing framework). I put it here as an example of installing other packages with pip.+++

[source,yaml]
----

build_script:
  - C:/Python34/python.exe setup.py build

----

+++The commands to build your Python project go here.+++

[source,yaml]
----

test_script:
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/py.test

----

+++Whatever you do to run your project tests go here.+++

[source,yaml]
----

deploy_script:
  - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload

----

+++This is the magic part; it runs bdist_wheel and uploads the result.+++

+++That's it! Pretty simple, no? Now, you can build Windows binary wheels easily.+++

++++++ **+++EDIT:+++** +++Someone pointed out in the comments that I completely ignored PyPI authentication. Luckily, it's a simple addition.+++

+++Go to your AppVeyor account and click your username in the top-right corner. Select "Encrypt Data" in the menu that appears.+++

+++replacing+++ ``+++value+++`` +++with the value you copied from the Encrypt Data page. Then, change the deploy_script part to read this:+++

deploy_script:
  - "echo [pypi] > %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
  - "echo username: user >> %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
  - "echo password: %password% >> %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
  - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
